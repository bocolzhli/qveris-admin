# Qveris Admin Console

This project is a standalone admin frontend built with Vite + React for the Qveris platform. It's kept in its own repository so it can evolve independently from the main backend and public-facing UI.

## Getting started

- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Run the dev server on port 5173 via `npm run dev`
- Build a production bundle with `npm run build`

Any additional documentation for the admin console should live in this repo under `docs/` so the interface can stay decoupled from backend docs.
